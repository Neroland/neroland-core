# Neroland Core — V1 (1.0.0) Checklist

> Public, line-by-line checklist for shipping Neroland Core 1.0.0. Rationale and phasing live in
> [`V1-PLAN.md`](V1-PLAN.md). Scope = the **full Core API surface**. Core is a library, not a content
> mod. Tick items as they land; each must build and pass `ecjCheck` on **all six cells**
> (`fabric / forge / neoforge` × MC `26.1.2 / 26.2`) before it counts as done.

## Legend

- `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done
- **(seam)** = needs a `common/` interface + three loader impls + `META-INF/services` entries
- **(api)** = part of the frozen public `api` package — design carefully, it can't break between majors

## Phase 1 — Registry & platform-seam plumbing

- [x] Define the ServiceLoader platform-seam pattern and a `Services` loader helper in `common/` **(seam)** — `platform/Services.java` + `platform/IPlatformHelper.java`, with `Fabric/Forge/NeoForgePlatformHelper` impls + service files
- [x] Cross-loader registration helper (register blocks/items/block-entities/creative tabs) **(seam)** — `registry/RegistrationProvider.java` + `Fabric/Forge/NeoForgeRegistrationFactory`
- [x] Creative-tab registration helper so downstream mods append into shared tabs **(api)** — `registry/CoreCreativeTab.java` (shared "Neroland" tab + `add(Supplier)` API)
- [x] Networking seam for server→client sync (config, gates, currency/reputation events) **(seam)** — delivered in Phase 3: `NetworkPlatform` + `CoreNetwork` payload registry + 3 loader impls; reused by gates + currency/reputation later
- [ ] Event-bus seam for economic/reputation/progression change events **(seam)** — deferred: built in Phase 4/5 alongside the first change events it carries
- [x] Wire each loader entry point (`NerolandCoreFabric/Forge/NeoForge`) through `NerolandCoreCommon.init()` — NeoForge/Forge also attach the DeferredRegisters via `registerAll(...)`
- [x] Keep `common/` free of `net.neoforged.*` / `net.fabricmc.*` / `net.minecraftforge.*` imports (verify) — grep clean (only javadoc references)

## Phase 2 — Materials, tags & datapack hooks

- [x] Register **Nero Alloy**: nugget, ingot, dust, plate, block — `ModBlocks` + `ModItems`
- [x] Register **Starsteel**: nugget, ingot, dust, plate, block
- [x] Register **Void Crystal**: shard, gem (`void_crystal`), dust, block (faint glow) — no plate (crystal)
- [x] Register **Plasma Glass**: shard item, transparent block, pane (`IronBarsBlock`)
- [x] Hand-author all item/block JSON (models, blockstates, lang) in `common/src/main/resources` — incl. loot tables + compaction recipes; procedural placeholder 16×16 textures (re-skin later)
- [x] Validate every JSON file after editing (no datagen in this multiloader) — 98 JSON files, all parse
- [x] Common-namespace tags for each form (`c:ingots/*`, `c:plates/*`, `c:dusts/*`, `c:gems/*`, `c:storage_blocks/*`, `c:glass_blocks`, `c:glass_panes`) + aggregates
- [x] `neroland:` material tags (`neroland:materials/<material>`, …) **(api)**
- [x] Place items into the shared Neroland creative tab (`ModItems.addToCreativeTab()`); tab icon = Nero Alloy ingot
- [x] Datapack hooks so packs can retune recipes/loot/tags without code — see `docs/TAGS-AND-DATAPACKS.md`
- [x] Document the `c:` vs `neroland:` namespace policy — `docs/TAGS-AND-DATAPACKS.md`
- [x] Mining tags (`minecraft:mineable/pickaxe`, `needs_iron_tool`) so solid blocks drop correctly

## Phase 3 — Config framework

- [x] Config service: typed schema registration with defaults + validation **(api)** — `ConfigManager` / `ConfigSchema` / `ConfigValue`
- [x] Shared on-disk file format + per-mod config files — `<modId>.properties`, defaults on first run, in-place key migration
- [x] `/neroland config reload` command with hot-reload — + `/neroland config list`; op level 2 (`LEVEL_GAMEMASTERS`)
- [x] Server-authoritative values sync to clients **(seam)** — `NetworkPlatform` seam + 3 loader impls; `CoreNetwork` + `ConfigSyncPayload`; sent on join + after reload
- [x] Config surfaces for: material stat baselines, upgrade-module slot cap + stacking diminish, energy ratio — `CoreConfig`
- [x] Datapack-level tuning hooks pair cleanly with config — documented in `docs/TAGS-AND-DATAPACKS.md` + `docs/CONFIG.md`
- [x] Document how a downstream mod registers a schema — `docs/CONFIG.md`

## Phase 4 — Progression-gate API

- [ ] Named progression flags stored per player / team / server **(api)**
- [ ] Gate query API (`isGateOpen("reached_orbit")`) **(api)**
- [ ] Server-authoritative storage + client sync; clients never mutate **(seam)**
- [ ] Team/party-aware gate state for co-op servers
- [ ] Datapack-overridable gate definitions (`industrial_power`, `reached_orbit`, `first_colony`, …)
- [ ] Change events so mods (e.g. NeroEvents) can react to gate flips
- [ ] Document how NeroQuests drives gates and others read them

## Phase 5 — Currency & reputation APIs

- [ ] Currency API: read/modify player balance, **named-currency** support from day one **(api)**
- [ ] Reputation API: query/adjust player↔faction reputation **(api)**
- [ ] Change events for both, subscribable by any mod **(api)**
- [ ] Confirm Core **stores nothing** — contracts only (NeroEconomy/NeroFactions implement storage)
- [ ] Reference no-op / in-memory impl for testing without downstream mods
- [ ] Document the provider contract for NeroEconomy and NeroFactions

## Phase 6 — Machine / power / upgrade framework

- [ ] Base machine block-entity downstream mods extend **(api)**
- [ ] Neroland energy unit power type **(api)**
- [ ] Bridges to common Forge/Fabric energy systems **(seam)**
- [ ] Config-driven energy conversion ratios (rough parity with Mekanism/FE)
- [ ] Upgrade-module system: typed slots, stackable modules, declared effects **(api)**
- [ ] Modifier resolution math with configurable caps
- [ ] Common upgrade-module serialization (so modules survive NeroLogistics transit later)
- [ ] Document how Nerotech/NeroPower extend the framework

## Phase 7 — Compliance, freeze & release

- [ ] Player records keyed by UUID store **only** gameplay state (no IP/chat/location beyond need)
- [ ] Retention/cleanup hook to purge data for players inactive past a configurable period
- [ ] Shared **per-player data-erasure hook** every Core-storing mod implements **(api)**
- [ ] Opt-out / data-reset command, documented
- [ ] Audit logging: no player data at `info` level; only public version strings; minimised + time-limited
- [ ] Split published `api` package from `impl`; freeze the API surface
- [ ] Document the deprecation / versioning policy (frozen between majors)
- [ ] Developer docs: how to depend on Core and use each system
- [ ] Bump `mod_version` to `1.0.0` in `gradle.properties`

## Final verification (do not skip)

- [ ] All six cells build: `:neoforge:26.1.2:build :neoforge:26.2:build :forge:26.1.2:build :forge:26.2:build :fabric:26.1.2:build :fabric:26.2:build`
- [ ] `ecjCheck` passes on each cell (errors only)
- [ ] All hand-authored JSON validates
- [ ] Smoke-test each loader in a dev client (materials show, tabs populate, `/neroland config reload` works, a test gate toggles)
- [ ] Confirm no third-party mod is a hard dependency — interop is tag-only
- [ ] Changes left **staged** for the developer — nothing committed or pushed automatically

## Notes

- Build order: Core is mod **#1**; nothing else in the ecosystem can be built cleanly until these
  contracts exist. See the umbrella
  [ROADMAP](https://github.com/dario-maselli/neroland-mc-ecosystem/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).
- External interop (Create / AE2 / Mekanism / Ad Astra) is delivered **only** through Core's common
  tags — never a hard or soft dependency.
- Resources are hand-authored; this multiloader does not run datagen.
